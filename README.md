## danmulvey's dotfiles

This is my current configuration, still trying new things and updating regularly.

dotfiles are included (and working) for
- zsh
- tmux
- neovim

### Installation

Run install.sh to symlink dotfiles from the repo. Use "./install.sh new" to backup existing dotfiles to .dotfiles/old first.

### todo

- [ ] unify themes so that everything matches
- [ ] update install.sh to check for existing files
- [ ] finish customizing neovim keymap and plugins
- [ ] add plugins for zsh (autocomplete, etc)
- [ ] consider switching to GNU stow, dotbot, or something similar for management
- [ ] add configurations for everything else (alacritty, rtorrent, neofetch, etc)
