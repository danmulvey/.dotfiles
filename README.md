### danmulvey's dotfiles

Current configuration, still a work in progress. 

## Installation

Run install.sh to symlink dotfiles from the repo. Use "./install.sh new" to backup existing dotfiles to .dotfiles/old first.

## TODO

I'm working on changing my neovim config over to lua along with some significant improvements, will update soon.
I also need to make some changes to the install script so that it checks for existing files, allows for different backup folder locations, and a few other things. I might switch over to something like GNU stow or dotbot, still need to try a few things out first.
